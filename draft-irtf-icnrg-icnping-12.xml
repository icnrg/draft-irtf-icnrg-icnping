      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Ascertaining data plane reachability to a destination and taking
	coarse performance measurements of round trip time are fundamental
	facilities for network administration and troubleshooting.  In IP,
	where routing and forwarding are based on IP addresses, ICMP echo
	and ICMP echo response are the protocol mechanisms used for this
	purpose, generally exercised through the familiar ping utility. In
	ICN, where routing and forwarding are based on name prefixes, the
	ability to ascertain reachability of names is required.</t>

      <t> This document proposes protocol mechanisms for a ping equivalent in
	ICN (<xref target="RFC8609">CCNx</xref> and <xref target="NDNTLV">NDN</xref>) networks. A non-normative appendix suggests useful properties for an ICN
	ping client application, analogous to IP ping, that originates echo requests
	and processes echo replies.</t>

	<t> In order to carry out meaningful experimentation and deployment of ICN
		protocols, tools to manage and debug the operation of ICN architectures and
		protocols are needed analogous to ping and traceroute used for TCP/IP.
		This document describes the design of a management and debugging protocol
		analogous to the ping protocol of TCP/IP, which will aid
		the experimental deployment of ICN protocols. As the community continues its
		experimentation with ICN architectures and protocols, the design of ICN Ping
		might change accordingly. ICN Ping is designed as a "first line of defense"
		tool to troubleshoot ICN architectures and protocols. As such, this document is
		classified as an experimental RFC. Note that a measurement application is
		needed to make proper use of ICN Ping in order to compute various statistics,
		such as the variance, average, maximum and minimum RTT values as well as loss rates.</t>

      <name>Background on IP-Based Ping Operation</name>
      <t>In IP-based ping, an IP address is specified by the user either directly, or via
            translation of a domain name through DNS. The ping client application
            sends a number of ICMP Echo Request packets with the specified IP
            address as the IP destination address and an IP address from the client's host
            as the IP source address.</t>
      <t>Each ICMP Echo Request is forwarded across
            the network based on its destination IP address. If it eventually reaches the
            destination, the destination responds by sending back an ICMP Echo Reply
            packet to the IP source address from the ICMP Echo Request.</t>
      <t>If an ICMP Echo Request does not reach the destination or the
            Echo reply is lost, the ping client times out. Any ICMP error messages,
            such as "no route to destination", generated by the ICMP Echo Request message
            are returned to the client and reported.</t>
    </section>
    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Ping Functionality Challenges and Opportunities in ICN</name>
      <t> In ICN, the communication paradigm is based exclusively on named
      objects. An Interest is forwarded across the network based on the name prefix that it carries.
      Eventually, a content object is retrieved either from a producer
      application or some forwarder's Content Store (CS).</t>
      <t>IP-based ping was built as an add-on measurement and debugging tool on top of an already existing network architecture. In ICN, we have the opportunity to incorporate diagnostic
      mechanisms directly in the network layer protocol, and hopefully provide more powerful
      diagnostic capability than can be realized through the layered ICMP Echo approach.</t>
      <t>An ICN network differs from an IP network in at least 4 important ways:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>IP identifies interfaces to an IP network with a fixed-length
              address, and delivers IP packets to one or more of these interfaces. ICN
              identifies units of data in the network with a variable length name
              consisting of a hierarchical list of name components.</li>
        <li>An IP-based network depends on the IP packets having source IP  addresses that are used as              the destination address for replies. On the other hand, ICN Interests do not have source addresses and they are forwarded  based on names, which do not refer to a unique end-point. Data packets follow the reverse path of the Interests based on hop-by-hop state
	      created during Interest forwarding.</li>
        <li>An IP network supports multi-path, single destination, stateless packet
              forwarding and delivery via unicast, a limited form of
              multi-destination selected delivery with anycast, and group-based
              multi-destination delivery via multicast. In contrast, ICN supports
              multi-path and multi-destination stateful Interest forwarding and
              multi-destination delivery of named data.  This single
              forwarding semantic subsumes the functions of unicast, anycast, and
              multicast.  As a result, consecutive (or retransmitted) ICN Interest
              messages may be forwarded through an ICN network along different
              paths, and may be forwarded to different data sources (e.g., end-node
              applications, in-network storage) holding a copy of the
              requested unit of data.  This can lead to a significant variance in
              round-trip times, which while resulting in a more robust overall forwarding architecture, has implications for a network
              troubleshooting mechanism like ping.</li>
        <li>In the case of multiple Interests with the same name arriving
              at a forwarder, a number of Interests may be aggregated in a common Pending
              Interest Table (PIT) entry and only one of them forwarded onward. Depending on the lifetime of a PIT entry,
              the round-trip time an Interest-Data exchange might significantly vary
              (e.g., it might be shorter than the full round-trip time to reach the
              original content producer). To this end, the round-trip time experienced
              by consumers might also vary.</li>
      </ul>

      <t>These differences introduce new challenges, new opportunities and new
      requirements in the design of an ICN ping protocol. Following this communication
      model, a ping client should be able to express ping echo requests
      with some name prefix and receive responses.</t>
      <t>Our goals are the following:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Test the reachability and the operational state of an ICN forwarder.</li>
        <li>Test the reachability of a producer or a data repository (in the sense of whether
	Interests for a prefix that it serves can be forwarded to it) and discover the
	forwarder with local connectivity to (an instance of) this producer or repository.</li>
        <li>Test whether a specific named object is cached in some on-path CS
					(e.g., a video segment with a name "/video/_seq=1”),
	and, if so, return the administrative name of the corresponding forwarder
	(e.g., a forwarder with an administrative name "/ISP/forwarder1”).</li>
        <li>Perform some simple network performance measurements, such as RTT and loss rate.</li>
      </ul>

      <t>To this end, a ping name can represent:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>An administrative name that has been assigned to a forwarder.</li>
        <li>A name that includes an application's namespace as a prefix.</li>
        <li>A named object that might reside in some in-network storage.</li>
      </ul>

      <t>In order to provide stable and reliable diagnostics, it is desirable that the
      packet encoding of a ping echo request enable the forwarders to
      distinguish a ping from a normal Interest, while also allowing for
      forwarding behavior to be as similar as possible to that of an
      Interest packet. In the same way, the encoding of a ping echo reply
      should allow for forwarder processing as close as possible to that used for data
      packets.</t>

      <t>The ping protocol should also enable relatively robust round-trip time
      measurements. To this end, it is valuable to have a mechanism to steer
      consecutive ping echo requests for the same name towards an individual path. Such a capability was initially published in  <xref target="PATHSTEERING" format="default"/> and has been specified for CCNx and NDN in <xref target="I-D.irtf-icnrg-pathsteering"/>.</t>

      <t>It is also important, in the case of ping echo requests for the same name from different sources to have a mechanism to avoid those requests being aggregated in the PIT. To this end, we need some encoding in the ping echo requests
      to make each request for a common name unique, hence avoiding PIT aggregation and
      further enabling the exact match of a response with a particular ping packet. However, avoiding PIT aggregation could lead to PIT DoS attacks.</t>

        <t>The echo request message is of type T_DISCOVERY. The Name TLV
       has the structure described in <xref target="RFC8609"/>.
       The name consists of the prefix that we would like to ping appended with
       a nonce typed name segment (T_NONCE) as its last segment. The nonce can be encoded as a base64-encoded string with the URL-safe alphabet as defined in Section 5 of <xref target="RFC4648"/>, with padding omitted. See <xref target="IANA"/> for the value assigned to this name segment type. The value of this TLV is a 64-bit nonce.
       The purpose of the nonce is to avoid Interest aggregation and allow client matching of replies with requests. As described below, the nonce is ignored for CS checking.</t>

      <name>Forwarder Handling</name>
      <t>We present the workflow of the forwarder's operation in <xref target="forwarder-operation"/>. When a forwarder receives an echo request, it first extracts the message's base name (i.e., the request name with the Nonce name segment excluded as well as	the suffix "ping" and the ParametersSha256DigestComponent in the case of an echo request with the NDN packet format).</t>
      
      <t>In some cases, the forwarder originates an echo reply,
	sending the reply downstream through the face on which the
	echo request was received. This echo reply includes the forwarder's
	own name and signature and the appropriate echo reply code based on the condition that
	triggered the reply generation. It also includes a Path label TLV, initially containing a
	null value (since the echo reply originator did not
	forward the request and, thus, does not make a path choice).</t>
      <t>The forwarder generates and returns an echo reply in the
	following cases:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Assuming that a forwarder has been given one or more administrative names,
	   the echo request base name exactly matches any of the forwarder's
	   administrative name(s).</li>
        <li>The echo request's base name exactly matches the name of a content-object
	   residing in the forwarder's CS (unless the ping client application
	   has chosen not to receive replies due to CS hits as specified in
	   <xref target="app-additional" format="default"/>).</li>
        <li>The echo request base name matches (in a Longest Prefix Match manner) a FIB
	   entry with an outgoing face referring to a local application.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>If none of the conditions to reply to the echo request are met, the
	forwarder will attempt to forward the echo request upstream based on the path
	steering value (if present), the results of the
	FIB LPM lookup and PIT creation (based on the name including the nonce typed name segment and the suffix "ping" in the case of an echo request with the NDN packet format). If no valid next-hop is found, an
	InterestReturn is sent downstream indicating "no route" (as with a failed attempt to
	forward an ordinary Interest).</t>
      <t>A received echo reply will be matched to an existing PIT entry as usual. On
	the reverse path, the path steering TLV of an echo reply will be updated
	by each forwarder to encode its next-hop choice. When included in subsequent
	echo requests, this  Path label TLV allows the forwarders to steer
	the echo requests along the same path.</t>

      <name>Protocol Operation For Locally-Scoped Namespaces</name>
      <t>In this section, we elaborate on 2 alternative design approaches in cases that
	the pinged prefix corresponds to a locally-scoped namespace not directly routable from the
	client's local network.</t>
      <t>The first approach leverages the NDN Link Object <xref target="SNAMP" format="default"/>.
	Specifically, the ping client attaches to the expressed request a LINK Object that
	contains a number of routable name prefixes, based on which the request can be forwarded
	until it reaches a network region where the request name itself is
	routable. A LINK Object is created and signed by a data producer allowed to
	publish data under a locally-scoped namespace. The way that a client retrieves a LINK Object
	depends on various network design factors and is out of the scope of the current draft.</t>
      <t>Based on the current usage of the LINK Object by the NDN team, a forwarder at the border
	of the region where an Interest name becomes routable must remove the LINK Object from
	incoming Interests. The Interest state maintained along the entire forwarding path is based on the
	Interest name regardless of whether it was forwarded based on its name or a routable prefix in the
	LINK Object.</t>
      <t>The second approach is based on prepending a routable prefix to the locally-scoped
	name. The resulting prefix will be the name of the echo requests expressed by the client.
	In this way, a request will be forwarded based on the routable
	part of its name. When it reaches the network region where the original locally-scoped
	name is routable, the border forwarder rewrites the request name and deletes
	its routable part. There are two conditions for a forwarder to perform this rewriting operation
	on a request: 1) the routable part of the request name
	matches a routable name of the network region adjacent to the forwarder (assuming that a forwarder is aware of
	those names) and 2) the remaining part of the request name is routable across the
	network region of this forwarder.</t>
      <t>The state maintained along the path, where the locally-scoped name is not routable, is based
	on the routable prefix along with the locally-scoped prefix. Within the network region that
	the locally-scoped prefix is routable, the state is based only on it. To ensure that the generated replies
	reach the ping client, the border forwarder has also to rewrite the name of a reply
	and prepend the routable prefix of the corresponding echo request.</t>
    </section>
    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>A reflection attack could be mounted by a compromised forwarder in the case of an echo reply with the CCNx packet format
      if that forwarder includes in the reply the name of a victim forwarder.
      This could convince a client to direct the future administrative traffic
      towards the victim. To foil such reflection attacks, the forwarder that generates a reply
      must sign the name included in the payload. In this way, the client is able to verify that the
      included name is legitimate and refers to the forwarder that generated the reply.
      Alternatively, the forwarder could include in the reply payload their routable
      prefix(es) encoded as a signed NDN Link Object <xref target="SNAMP" format="default"/>.</t>

      <t>Interest flooding attack amplification is possible in the case of the second approach to deal
      with locally-scoped namespaces described in <xref target="local" format="default"/>. To eliminate such amplification,
      a border forwarder will have to maintain extra state in order to prepend the correct routable prefix
      to the name of an outgoing reply, since the forwarder might be attached to
      multiple network regions (reachable under different prefixes) or a network region attached to this
      forwarder might be reachable under multiple routable prefixes.</t>

			<t>Another example of an attack could be the ICN equivalent of port knocking, where an attacker
				tries to discover certain forwarder implementations for the purpose of exploiting potential vulnerabilities.</t>

      <name>Ping Client Application (Consumer) Operation</name>
      <t>This section is an informative appendix regarding the proposed ping client
      operation.</t>
      <t>The ping client application is responsible for generating echo requests for
     prefixes provided by users.</t>
      <t>When generating a series of echo requests for a specific name, the first
       echo request will typically not include a Path label TLV, since no TLV value
       is known. After an echo reply containing a Path label TLV is received, each
       subsequent echo request can include the received path steering value
       in the Path label header TLV to drive the requests towards a common path
       as part of checking network performance. To discover more paths, a client can
       omit the path steering TLV in future requests. Moreover, for each new ping echo
       request, the client has to generate a new nonce and record the time that the
       request was expressed. It will also set the lifetime of an echo request,
       which will have identical semantics to the lifetime of an Interest.</t>
      <t>Further, the client application might not wish to receive echo replies due to
      CS hits. A mechanism to achieve that in CCNx would be to use a Content Object Hash
      Restriction TLV with a value of 0 in the payload of an echo request message. In NDN,
      the exclude filter selector can be used.</t>
      <t>When it receives an echo reply, the client would typically match the reply to a sent
      request and compute the round-trip time of the request. It should parse the
      Path label value and decode the reply's payload to parse the
      the sender's name and signature. The client should verify that both
      the received message and the forwarder's name have been signed by the
      key of the forwarder, whose name is included in the payload of the reply (by
      fetching this forwarder's public key and verifying the contained signature). The client
      can also decode the Echo Reply Code TLV to understand the condition that triggered
      the generation of the reply.</t>
      <t>In the case that an echo reply is not received for a request within a certain
      time interval (lifetime of the request), the client should time-out and send a new
      request with a new nonce value up to some maximum number of requests
      to be sent specified by the user.</t>
